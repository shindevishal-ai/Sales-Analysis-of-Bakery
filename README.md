# Sales-Analysis-of-Bakery

The bakery business can greatly benefit from the use of Business Intelligence (BI) tools and analysis.
To explore this, the dataset in the .XLSX file provides raw data about the bakery's operations, sales, and customer preferences. 
The .pbix file contains the processed BI model, which allows for interactive analysis and visualization of trends, patterns, and performance metrics. 
Additionally, the accompanying PDF file includes static visual images extracted from the BI tool, offering an accessible summary of key insights. 
Together, these resources provide a comprehensive view of the bakery's business performance, enabling data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.
